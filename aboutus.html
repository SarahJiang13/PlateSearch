      <h2>Geroge Man</h2>
      <h5>Founder of RPS</h5>
      <img src=Geroge.jpg>
      <p>Geroge Man is the founder of RPS. When he wasa younger boy, he used to live with his father in a small rural country where animals were not regarded as important. Geroge was raised to believe that animals were just animals
        and did not hold any significance like human. When he was 5 he found a bead possum and kids poking the coprse, he felt bad which is why he soon after dedicated his whole life to ensure that animals were saved and treat just like a living 
        person and not just some animal. Geroge is now 25 and still continues to keep this foundation going with as muhc power as he can. Geroge believes that there will be a day where there will be no need to spread awareness as poeple would have 
        already known how important animals are.

      <h2>History of RPS</h2>
      <h5>RPS was founded on, Dec 12, 2017 with George and his 3 friends</h5>
      <img src=Gerogefriend.jpg >
      <p>Geroge, Kristen and Mark</p>
      <p>Geroge, Kristen and Mark were great friends when they were younger and when Geroge foolishly suggested that they start an animal rescue group when drunk on day, they all complaied and hence started the development of the RPS.
        Not a lot of money could be put into the RPS and so they dropped the idea, that was until 2 years later when they reunited and decided that they were officially going to start the RPS group.
