    <h1>What to consider before adoption</h1>
  </div>  
<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h3>Will they fit into your lifestyle?</h3>
        <p>A lot of dogs and puppies wind up being abandoned due to people being unable to fit them into their lifestyles and not having enough time to look after the them. Please ensure that when you begin considering adoption that you can look after you dog well and fit them into your daily life.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h3>Are you willing to spend enough money?</h3>
        <p>A pretty straight forward point that most people are aware of but don't look into thouroughly. Everyone is aware that keeping a pet can be quite pricey so please ensure that you are willing to use a big amount of money on your dogs to ensure that they live a happy comfortable life. Grooming, food, water and sufficent exercise is also required</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h3>Do your research </h3>        
        <p>Please ensure that you are prepared for all the responsibility that fall on not only you but also your family. Getting the pet that is just right for you and your family is difficult so please ensure that you pick the right one. Every dog is perfect in everyway but please ensure that it is perfect for you as everyone has different preferences.</p>
