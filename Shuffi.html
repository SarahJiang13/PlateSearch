  <p>Shuffi is full of energy and loves adventures, she loves being let off to explore on her own. She will always find her way back so there is no need to worry about her getting lost. She will wonder off on her alone very often and find new friends, she tends to bring back a new friend and sometimes they aren't as pleasent as she hopes them to be. To meet me please:
