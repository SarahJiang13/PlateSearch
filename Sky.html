  <p>Sky is a young hyper puppy, he loves belly rubs and playing outside. Sky was found in a box that was abandoned on the side of the road, he hates dark cramped places so if you have a small sapce for him please avoid. He loves being out in the open but and playing with his toys but most importantly he loves rolling up in a ball on his friends chest. To meet me please:</p>
