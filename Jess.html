  <p>Jess is an extremely young puppy that was abandoned when she was a month old which is why she would require extra attention. She is lovely and loves to play with anyone. She has an open heart and loves everything. She is an extremely cheerful pupopy and has never been down, even after all her difficulties as a puppy.
